Known Issue

There is an issue regarding the performance. The game may experience a delay on the path of execution but it corrects itself in some time.
Slow motion won't work as delta time calculation is not implemented yet.


How to USE
 
The Game supports following keys

S -> Rotate Ship anticlockwise
F -> Rotate Ship Clockwise
E -> Move Ship Forward direction
Space -> Shoots bullets

The game also supports XBox Controller.

Ship movement is made possible with LeftStick of XBox controller
Button A helps in Shooting bullets.


You can expect an enemy ship to shoot you and watch you all time. Beware.!!

DeepLearning

While programming this game I really came to know the importance of time management and importance of code cleanability.
Both of these should be taken care from the initial stages of development. Need to split projects into modules and plan
a day to complete and test it with clean code. Code cleanability helps when we try to add more
feature  on top of the existing code.Initial stages were not tougher as the program looks simple so I was coding without
any structure. But once the code increased to a certain level of complexity I find it very difficult to add features as
proper framework was not set up before I could code.I usually code starting from the main feature. But I felt adding 
basic engine codes first is necessary for gaining good speed. And also I learned to think to the future, from now I should plan before
I really start coding. each methods.This is because same methods can be used in many places if we structure the function properly
So my takeaway is that I should spent ambient time on paper, writing the structure and thinking about the strcuture of code
before I put that into CPP. It is always better to spend time visualizing putting into paper before writting code, than restructuring 
the code for every new feature.
