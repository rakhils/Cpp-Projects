Deep Learning

For the first time I started with top down coding approach and it worked really well. I started with declaring functions
and if conditions and sorting out the first problem and testing it. Along With coding the unit testing also gets comleted
This really helped in getting the AI for enemies and allies.From last project i learned alot about time management 
this time i started coding everyday atleast an hour which made me complete the project with juice one day before. It 
reduced alot of stress. Knowing visual studio tricks is really important in many ways. It helps debugging easier and 
makes structring easier.Knowing the tools is almost as important as knowing programming. I am still learning new tricks
in visual studio everday cause i believe it helps my productivity.
